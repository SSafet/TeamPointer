Real-time, customizable agile estimation for remote and co-located teams. Team Pointer is a simple yet powerful planning poker application designed to make sprint planning sessions interactive, efficient, and fun.

## Overview

Team Pointer is a web-based tool that facilitates agile estimation and planning. It allows teams to collaboratively estimate the effort required for development tasks using a customizable deck of voting cards. The application is built with a focus on real-time interaction and ease of use, ensuring that both local and remote teams can participate seamlessly.

The moderator creates a session, adds stories, and controls the voting rounds. Participants join the session, cast their votes, and discuss the results, which are stored for historical reference.

## âœ¨ Key Features

-   **Real-time Sessions**: Synchronized experience for all participants using Socket.IO.
-   **Customizable Voting Decks**: Define your own voting scaleâ€”use Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, or any custom values. The app even remembers your last-used deck.
-   **Moderator Controls**: Full control over the session, including adding/deleting stories, selecting a story for voting, and revealing or resetting votes.
-   **Persistent Results**: The app remembers the outcome of every vote, making it easy to review past estimates.
-   **Individual Vote History**: See exactly how each participant voted on a completed story.
-   **Automatic Moderator Transfer**: If the current moderator disconnects, ownership is automatically transferred to the next active participant.
-   **Resilient Participant Handling**: If a participant disconnects after voting, their vote remains part of the result.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
